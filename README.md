DWM
===

DWM is a .NET Wrapper over the Desktop Window Manager library introduced with
Windows Vista.

I wrote it in 2008, when Vista came out and I was doing a lot of Win32 
programming (with WinForms). The library exposes some of the new UI 
capabilities introduced with Vista, like BlurBehind and thumbnails for windows.

At that time, there was no equivalent .NET library to leverage the native API
as far as I'm aware of. No idea what's the current state of things.

Now on GitHub as part of #throwbackthursday, as I plan to publish my old hobby
projects whenever I find the source code.

Installation
------------

Stick the files under `src` into a C# project and try to build them, might 
still work.

Documentation
-------------

Good old .chm file is here: https://github.com/vladris/DWM/blob/master/doc/DWM%20Managed%20API%20Help.chm
